ata Centric Development Milestone Project
BY AYOBAMI OSOMO
This is a website designed to allow users to create, view, edit and delete food recipes. The website will store the recipes they have created and display these in lists for the user to interact with.
UX
This project is aimed at cooking enthusiasts, students living alone and parents looking for something to cook for their family. I have attempted to keep the design and interactivity simple and intuitive enough that anybody can make sense of it and make use of the site. As the site is aimed at those who may not be so computer literate, I have attempted to design the UX in such a way that it is easy to read and understand, showing relevant information and pointing users to the various features of the site.
